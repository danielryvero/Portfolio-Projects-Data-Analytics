# Data Preparation for Visualization - COVID

Creating a proper table in a database in pgAdmin 4
that can receive the data from a large [COVID Dataset](/Data%20Preparation%20-%20Visualization%20-%20COVID/Raw%20Datasets/) that shows info from the start of the pandemic till the day this project was constructed.

SQL queries available [here](/Data%20Preparation%20-%20Visualization%20-%20COVID/COVID_Data_prep_Visualization.sql).

Tables to load into Tableau are [here](/Data%20Preparation%20-%20Visualization%20-%20COVID/Tables%20for%20Tableau/).

Visualization available at my profile in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel.rivero5056/viz/COVIDDashboardTutorial_17077654051000/Project).
