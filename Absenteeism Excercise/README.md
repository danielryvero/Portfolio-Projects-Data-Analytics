# Cleaning data with Absenteeism Excercise

Data cleaning is one of the most time-consuming and effort-needed parts of the whole process. Given this [dataset](/Absenteeism%20Excercise/Absenteeism_Excercise_dataset.csv) that shows the absence from work during normal working hours, we will transform it and obtain a final result of a [clean dataset](/Absenteeism%20Excercise/df_cleaned.csv).

Queries used are [here](/Absenteeism%20Excercise/Absenteeism%20excercise_complete.ipynb), in Jupyter Notebook.
